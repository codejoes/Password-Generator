# Password Generator Starter Code

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## A challenge to create a functioning password generator using provided HTML and CSS shell.

I used a predesigned webpage and wrote JavaScript code to make a functional password generator.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This webpage will generate an alert message when loaded up instructing users to input the correct type of data and how much data in order for the password generator to return a secure password. The input should be only numbers and the total number of letters, numbers, and symbols should be at least 8, but less than 128.
